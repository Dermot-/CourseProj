======================
"act_desc" is one of the six Activity Descriptions in text form.
"subject" is the reference number for each of the 30 participants.
The remaining fields are averages of each of the values.  The averages have been 
calculated by subject and at an overall level for all subjects. The overall averages
appear as subject 0 (zero).
